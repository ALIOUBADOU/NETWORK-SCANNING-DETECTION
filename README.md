# NETWORK-SCANNING-DETECTION
On this project we have used a labelled dataset of a network flow and we have tried throught supervidsed learning to define weither a scanning action is lunched or not and make analysis of the result .
The following algorithms have been used:

Logistic regression for classification.

K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) model for classification.

Support Vector Machine model for classification.

Visualization and analyze of the results.

You have to download both dataset and jupyter-notebook file in the same folder before executing the codes.
